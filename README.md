# Text Generation with Neural Networks

**1. LSTM model with Keras for text generation (char-to-char)**

`python Keras_LSTM_text_generation.py file_with_plain_text.txt`


**2. LSTM model with Lasagne for text generation (char-to-char)**

`python Lasagne_LSTM_text_generation.py file_with_plain_text.txt`

Change hyperparameters inside the scripts.

**3. Some useful resouces for text generation by using RNNs**
